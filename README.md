# Relay Node Placement for IOT Networks with Imperfect Communication Ranges

## Project Overview

This focus of this research project is to develop a novel relay node placement algorithm targetted for practical applications.

## Preliminary Presentations

1. *School of Mines Undergraduate Research Symposium*: https://www.mines.edu/undergraduate-research/relay-node-placement-for-iot-networks-with-imperfect-communication-ranges/

## TO-DO

1. ~~Design small computer cases to prevent wire-tugging when arduinos are mounted.~~
1. Convert current docs paper to latex format.
1. Continue to develop README.
1. Modify Python computer simulation code.
   1. There is currently a bug with the 3-star placement which needs attention.
   1. Clean up and make input more friendly. It should be reading from CSV or txt, not console input.
1. Work on wiring for reset switch on arduinos.
1. Create wiring schematic for current arduino setup.
1. Need a more friendly solution for serial communication between the arduinos and the base station.
1. Redesign for the front-end of the network management software.
    1. Enhance UI with a side menu.
    1. Add more client control over the network.
    1. Finish password validation.
    1. ~~Implement pbkdf2_hmac encryption for passwords.~~
    1. Automated testing capabilities can be monitored on the front end.
    1. 
1. After 3-star placement is corrected in the simulator, assemble topologies for test networks.
1. Script for automated testing.
